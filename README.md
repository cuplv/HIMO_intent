## HIMO: Logic-Based Hierarchical Intent Monitoring for Mobile Robots

HIMO is a framework that uses temporal logic specifications to infer the unknown intent of a robotic agent through passive observations of its actions over time.

  <i>Intent monitoring can be key to enabling a humanrobot collaboration. If the robot is aware of that chefâ€™s intent is to repeatedly bring a pot, water, meat, in order, and then go to the cooktop, it can help the chef by bringing meats while he is going to get some water, or can avoid collisions predicting their future positions.</i>

## Testing HIMO

You can test HIMO on a random environment with `High-level-monitor.ipynb` or on a Thor dataset with `thor_test.ipynb`.
